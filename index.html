                            <h2>Plot Summary</h2>

							<p>Anne Shirley, a young orphan from the fictional community of Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia (based upon the real community of New London, Prince Edward Island),is sent to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, unmarried siblings in their fifties and sixties, after a childhood spent in strangers' homes and orphanages. Marilla and Matthew had originally decided to adopt a boy from the orphanage to help Matthew run their farm at Green Gables, which is set in the fictional town of Avonlea (based on Cavendish, Prince Edward Island). Through a misunderstanding, the orphanage sends Anne instead. </p>

							<p>Anne is fanciful, imaginative, eager to please, and dramatic. She is also adamant her name should always be spelt with an e at the end. However, she is defensive about her appearance, despising her red hair, freckles and pale, thin frame, but liking her nose. She is talkative, especially when it comes to describing her fantasies and dreams. At first, stern Marilla says Anne must return to the orphanage, but after much observation and consideration, along with kind, quiet Matthew's encouragement, Marilla decides to let her stay.</p>
							
							<blockquote>“My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.” </blockquote>

							<p>Anne Shirley: An imaginative, talkative, red-haired orphan who comes to live with Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert at age 11. Anne is very sensitive and dislikes the colour of her hair. Anne's bleak early childhood was spent being shuttled from orphanage to foster homes, caring for younger children. She is excited to finally have a real home at Green Gables.


							Marilla Cuthbert: Matthew's sister, an austere but fair woman who has the "glimmerings of a sense of humour." Her life has been colourless and without joy until the arrival of Anne. She tries to instill discipline in the child but grows to love Anne's vivacity and joy.


						    Matthew Cuthbert: Marilla's brother, a shy, kind man who takes a liking to Anne from the start. The two become fast friends and he is the first person who has ever shown Anne unconditional love. Although Marilla has primary responsibility for rearing Anne, Matthew has no qualms about "spoiling" her and indulging her with pretty clothes and fancy shoes.</p>

							<h3>Anne's friends/classmates</h3>

							<p>Diana Barry: Anne's bosom friend and a kindred spirit. Anne and Diana become best friends from the moment they meet. She is the only girl of Anne's age who lives close to Green Gables. Anne admires Diana for being pretty with black hair and flawless complexion and for her amiable disposition. Diana lacks Anne's vivid imagination but is a loyal friend.
							Gilbert Blythe: A handsome, smart, and witty classmate, two years older than Anne, who has a crush on her. Unaware of Anne's sensitivity about her red hair, he tries to get her attention by holding her braid and calling her "Carrots" in the classroom, and she breaks a slate over his head. Despite his attempts at an apology, Anne's anger and stubbornness prevent her from speaking to him for several years. By the end of the book, however, they reconcile and become good friends.
							Ruby Gillis: Another of Anne's friends. Having several "grown-up" sisters, Ruby loves to share her knowledge of beaux with her friends. Ruby is beautiful, with long golden hair.
							Jane Andrews: One of Anne's friends from school, she is plain and sensible. She does well enough academically to join Anne's class at Queen's.
							Josie Pye: A classmate generally disliked by the other girls (as are her siblings), Josie is vain, dishonest, and jealous of Anne's popularity.
							Prissy Andrews: Another school companion of Anne's, who is assumed to be in a relationship with the teacher, Mr. Phillips.</p>

								<h2>Anne of Green Gables Attraction in Prince Edward Island </h2>

						<img src="http://avonlea.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/avonlea_hero-1024x581.jpg" jsaction="load:XAeZkd;" jsname="HiaYvf" class="n3VNCb KAlRDb" alt="Avonlea Village – Avonlea Village" data-noaft="1" style="width: 433px; height: 245.677px; margin: 0px;">


						<h3>1. Green Gables Heritage Place</h3>

							

							<p>It’s anything but a secret destination, but no discussion of Anne of Green Gables would be complete without including Green Gables Heritage Place. This is the house where Anne dyed her hair green, set her friend drunk, and let a mouse drown in pudding sauce. It’s also where she would eat plates of russet apples with Matthew in front of the mid-winter fire and master biscuits so light and fluffy that even Marilla couldn’t find fault in them. How could you not stop by?</p>

							<h3>2. Blue Winds Tea Room</h3>


							<p>Many Island cafes have an Anne-inspired recipe, but few match the dedication of the Blue Winds Tea Room. The owners are devoted Montgomery fans and make both homemade raspberry cordial and new moon pudding based on Montgomery’s own recipe.</p>


							<h3>3. Avonlea Village</h3>

							<h3>4. Kensington Railway Station</h3>

							<p>Anne fans will instantly recognize the Kensington Railway Station, as it was featured in the 1985 Anne of Green Gables miniseries. The station is where a young Lucy Maud took her first train rides and pasted flowers from the voyages into her many beloved scrapbooks.</p>

							<h3>5. Anne of Green Gables Museum</h3>

							<p>Anne’s beloved Lake of Shining Waters is very real, and you can find it here by the Campbell homestead, now known as the Anne of Green Gables Museum. Once the home of Montgomery’s aunt and uncle, the museum preserves the author’s teenage quilting and artistic efforts. Alas, dramatic lakeside reenactments of the “Lady of Shalott” aren’t possible, but a carriage ride from “Matthew” is.  </p>

							<h3>6. New London Lighthouse</h3>

							<p>This beautiful historic building was featured in the Anne of Green Gables miniseries, and the New London lighthouse may have been the inspiration for the revolving channel light mentioned in another Montgomery book, Jane of Lantern Hill. </p>
