							<h2>Anne of Green Gables Attraction in Prince Edward Island </h2>

						<h3>1. Green Gables Heritage Place</h3>

							

							<p>It’s anything but a secret destination, but no discussion of Anne of Green Gables would be complete without including Green Gables Heritage Place. This is the house where Anne dyed her hair green, set her friend drunk, and let a mouse drown in pudding sauce. It’s also where she would eat plates of russet apples with Matthew in front of the mid-winter fire and master biscuits so light and fluffy that even Marilla couldn’t find fault in them. How could you not stop by?</p>

							<h3>2. Blue Winds Tea Room</h3>


							<p>Many Island cafes have an Anne-inspired recipe, but few match the dedication of the Blue Winds Tea Room. The owners are devoted Montgomery fans and make both homemade raspberry cordial and new moon pudding based on Montgomery’s own recipe.</p>


							<h3>3.Avonlea Village</h3>

							<h3>4. Kensington Railway Station</h3>

							<p>Anne fans will instantly recognize the Kensington Railway Station, as it was featured in the 1985 Anne of Green Gables miniseries. The station is where a young Lucy Maud took her first train rides and pasted flowers from the voyages into her many beloved scrapbooks.</p>

							<h3>5. Anne of Green Gables Museum</h3>

							<p>Anne’s beloved Lake of Shining Waters is very real, and you can find it here by the Campbell homestead, now known as the Anne of Green Gables Museum. Once the home of Montgomery’s aunt and uncle, the museum preserves the author’s teenage quilting and artistic efforts. Alas, dramatic lakeside reenactments of the “Lady of Shalott” aren’t possible, but a carriage ride from “Matthew” is.  </p>

							<h3>6. New London Lighthouse</h3>

							<p>This beautiful historic building was featured in the Anne of Green Gables miniseries, and the New London lighthouse may have been the inspiration for the revolving channel light mentioned in another Montgomery book, Jane of Lantern Hill. </p>
